## 1. SUMMARY

I am filing this complaint regarding discriminatory business practices by [Company Name], which:
- **Operates commercially in Brazil** (registered CNPJ, employs Brazilians, sells to Brazilian market)
- **Excludes Brazilian residents** from participating in technology competitions/hackathons
- **Falsely claims legal prohibitions** as justification for exclusion

## 2. FACTS

### 2.1. Company's Brazilian Operations
The respondent company:
- Maintains active business registration in Brazil (CNPJ: [number])
- Employs Brazilian professionals
- Generates revenue from Brazilian customers
- Pays taxes in Brazil
- Actively markets its products/services to Brazilian consumers and businesses

### 2.2. Discriminatory Exclusion
On [date], I submitted a project titled "AIR-Navigator (Agentic Incident Response Navigator)" to a hackathon organized by the respondent.

I received official notification (attached) stating:

> "Per the official rules, residents of Brazil are not eligible. The Hackathon is NOT open to: Individuals who are residents of [...] Brazil [...] where the laws of the United States or local law prohibits participating or receiving a prize"

### 2.3. False Legal Justification

**The stated justification is demonstrably false:**

1. **Brazil is NOT under OFAC sanctions** (US Treasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control)
2. **Brazil is NOT subject to US embargoes** (unlike Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia/Crimea)
3. **No Brazilian law prohibits** participation in international competitions
4. **No US law prohibits** Brazilian participation in hackathons

The company groups Brazil alongside:
- Countries under actual US sanctions (Cuba, Iran, North Korea)
- Allied democracies with no restrictions (Germany, France, Italy, Spain, Australia, Canada)

### 2.4. Corporate Hypocrisy

The company's position is internally contradictory:
- ✅ CAN operate in Brazil and profit from Brazilian market
- ✅ CAN hire Brazilian employees
- ✅ CAN sell to Brazilian customers
- ❌ CANNOT allow Brazilians to participate in its competitions

## 3. LEGAL AND ETHICAL VIOLATIONS

### 3.1. False Advertising / Deceptive Practices
The company falsely claims legal prohibitions that do not exist, which constitutes:
- Misrepresentation to the public
- False justification for discriminatory practices
- Potential violation of FTC Act Section 5 (unfair or deceptive acts)

### 3.2. Violation of OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises
**Chapter IV - Human Rights:**
- Principle 2: "Avoid causing or contributing to adverse human rights impacts"
- Principle 5: "Provide for or cooperate in remediation when they have caused or contributed to adverse impacts"

**Chapter VII - Consumer Interests:**
- Enterprises should conduct business in a manner consistent with fair business practices

### 3.3. Violation of UN Global Compact Principles (if applicable)
**Principle 6:** "Businesses should uphold the elimination of discrimination in respect of employment and occupation"

While this applies to employment, the broader principle of non-discrimination is violated when a company:
- Operates in a country
- Profits from that country's market
- Discriminates against that country's professionals

### 3.4. Anticompetitive Practices
This exclusion:
- Creates artificial barriers to entry for Brazilian innovators
- Limits competition in global technology markets
- Damages the international innovation ecosystem
- Provides unfair advantage to developers from "approved" countries

## 4. MARKET IMPACT

### 4.1. Harm to Brazilian Technology Ecosystem
Brazil has:
- 500,000+ software developers
- The 7th largest tech market globally
- One of the fastest-growing AI/ML communities
- Significant innovation capacity

Systematic exclusion from international competitions:
- Limits Brazilian innovation visibility
- Reduces opportunities for Brazilian tech professionals
- Damages Brazil's competitiveness in global tech markets

### 4.2. Reputational Harm to the Company
This practice creates:
- PR risks in Brazilian market (where the company operates)
- Backlash from global developer community
- Contradiction with stated corporate values (typically: diversity, inclusion, innovation)

### 4.3. Precedent Risk
If this practice goes unchallenged, other companies may adopt similar discriminatory policies, further marginalizing developers from Brazil and other excluded countries.

## 5. EVIDENCE

1. Official exclusion email (attached)
2. Hackathon official rules (showing false legal claims)
3. Company's Brazilian business registration (CNPJ proof)
4. Documentation of company's Brazilian operations
5. Confirmation that Brazil is NOT under OFAC sanctions
6. [Additional supporting documentation]

## 6. REQUESTS

I respectfully request that the relevant authorities:

1. **INVESTIGATE** the respondent's discriminatory practices
2. **REQUIRE** the company to provide actual legal documentation justifying Brazil's exclusion
3. **DETERMINE** whether false claims of legal prohibitions constitute deceptive practices
4. **ASSESS** whether this practice violates international business conduct standards
5. **RECOMMEND** remedial actions, including:
   - Removal of unjustified geographical restrictions
   - Clear distinction between countries under actual sanctions vs. corporate policy exclusions
   - Transparency about the true reasons for exclusions
6. **PUBLISH** guidance on discriminatory practices by companies operating across multiple markets

## 7. BROADER IMPLICATIONS

This case represents a broader pattern in the technology industry where companies:
- Operate globally and profit from diverse markets
- Exclude professionals from those same markets from opportunities
- Use false legal justifications to avoid accountability

This undermines:
- International competition
- Global innovation
- Equity in the technology sector
- Trust in multinational corporations

## 8. DECLARATION

I declare, under penalty of perjury under the laws of the United States (28 U.S.C. § 1746) and equivalent legal standards in other jurisdictions, that the information provided in this complaint is true and accurate to the best of my knowledge.

## APPENDIX: Impact on International Developer Community

This practice does not affect only me individually. It systematically excludes:
- **Brazilian developers:** 500,000+ professionals
- **Plus developers from:** Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Argentina, Australia, Hong Kong, Indonesia, Malaysia, Poland, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, Singapore, UAE

This represents **millions of technology professionals** excluded from opportunities by companies that actively operate in and profit from their countries.

The practice demands regulatory attention and remediation.
