# Resposta Ã  Sara S - Questionamento de Elegibilidade

**Subject:** Re: AIR-Navigator Submission - Request for Clarification on Brazil's Exclusion

Dear Sara,

Thank you for your message regarding my submission AIR-Navigator (Agentic Incident Response Navigator).

While I understand there are geographical restrictions, I respectfully request clarification on the following points:

## 1. Legal Basis for Brazil's Exclusion

The official rules state that the hackathon is not open to countries "where the laws of the United States or local law prohibits participating or receiving a prize."

**However:**
- Brazil is **not under any OFAC sanctions or US Treasury restrictions**
- Brazil is **not listed** among countries with US embargoes (unlike Russia, Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, and Crimea, which are legitimately sanctioned)
- The hackathon organizer operates in Brazil with a registered CNPJ [insert CNPJ if known], paying Brazilian taxes and employing Brazilian professionals

**Question:** Could you please provide specific legal documentation showing which US or Brazilian law prohibits Brazilian residents from participating in this competition?

## 2. Inconsistency in Geographic Restrictions

The list groups Brazil alongside:
- **Sanctioned countries** (Cuba, Iran, North Korea, Syria, Russia/Crimea) - which face actual US legal prohibitions
- **Allied democracies** (Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Australia, Canada/Quebec) - which have no US restrictions

This grouping appears to be based on internal corporate policy rather than actual legal prohibitions as stated in the rules.

**Question:** Is this exclusion based on:
- a) Mandatory legal compliance, or
- b) Corporate risk management policy?

If it's (b), I would argue this creates reputational risk for organizations operating in excluded markets while simultaneously excluding their local talent communities.

## 3. Request for Reconsideration

I respectfully propose the following alternatives:

**Option A:** Allow participation without monetary prize (recognition/certificate only)
**Option B:** Prize donation to a Brazilian educational institution
**Option C:** Clarify that the restriction is corporate policy, not legal mandate

## 4. Feedback for Future Competitions

As someone who invested time developing a solution for this hackathon, I believe the current policy:
- Damages the organization's reputation in major tech markets (Brazil is the 2nd largest developer community for several major tech platforms)
- Excludes talent from countries where your organization actively operates and profits
- Creates PR risks when local communities discover the contradiction

I hope this feedback helps improve future competition structures to be more inclusive of the markets where your organization does business.

I would appreciate a response addressing these specific points, particularly the legal documentation question.
